<h2>intro</h2>

my name is **pin** (a.k.a. Luiz Felipe)

- 📍 born, raised and living in brazil since '85
- 🏢 currently working as software engineer since 2008
- ❤️ passionate about health and fitness, nutrition, each and every sport on earth (and maybe out of it, if I ever get the chance)
- 💪 I'm also a mediocre bodybuilder, trying to get to 212/7%@5'8, missing a few pounds :(
